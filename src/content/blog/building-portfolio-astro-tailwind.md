# Building My Portfolio with Astro and Tailwind

When I decided to rebuild my personal portfolio, I wanted something that was fast, maintainable, and easy to update. After researching various options, I settled on Astro with Tailwind CSS, and I couldn't be happier with the results.

## Why Astro?

Astro stood out for several reasons:

- **Zero JavaScript by default** - Only loads what you actually need
- **Component-based architecture** - Reusable, maintainable code
- **Markdown support** - Perfect for blog posts
- **Excellent performance** - Static generation with minimal overhead

## The Tech Stack

- **Astro** - Static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Markdown** - Content management

## Project Structure

The beauty of Astro is its intuitive file-based routing system. Here's how I organized my project:

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── content/        # Blog posts and content
├── layouts/        # Page layouts
└── pages/          # File-based routing
```

## Performance Benefits

Since switching to Astro, my portfolio scores consistently 100/100 on Lighthouse. The combination of static generation and minimal JavaScript creates an incredibly fast user experience.

## Easy Content Management

Adding new blog posts is as simple as creating a markdown file. No database, no complex CMS - just version-controlled content that deploys automatically.

## Conclusion

Astro and Tailwind have proven to be an excellent combination for building a modern, fast, and maintainable portfolio. If you're considering a similar setup, I highly recommend giving it a try!
